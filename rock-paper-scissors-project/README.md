Pulled from The Odin Project curriculum, this project aims to create a console.log-based game. The user will compete against a computer at the game rock, paper, scissors for ten rounds or five rounds won, whichever is first. 

------
The original assignment intended the user to interact with alerts and type their responses. 
The curriculum had me revisit the assignment and modify it to have the user interact with buttons. This way, I learned about event listeners and modifying HTML through JS code.

This project drew from my knowledge of variable scope, different kinds of loops, and piecing multiple functions together.

I hope that this project tests and enhances my JavaScript knowledge and that you find it entertaining to play. Enjoy!
