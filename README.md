Pulled from The Odin Project curriculum, this project aims to create a console.log-based game. The user will compete against a computer at the game rock, paper, scissors in a best-of-five format. 

It serves as a distillation of my JavaScript knowledge so far. Implementation is rudimentary, as the output of functions will be viewed only in the Dev Tools console log. Additionally, I am using HTML as a vehicle to host <script>, so there will be minimal HTML code and no CSS. 

I'm hoping that this project tests and enhances my JavaScript knowledge and that you find it entertaining to play. Enjoy!
